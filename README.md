# Twitter-network-Zika

# Description
The aim of the project is to know the influence of social media in healthcare. We selected a particular keyword “zika” and we have extracted all the tweets having zika in 10 metropolitan cities including ny, philadelphia, san fran,  chicago etcc. and we have performed network analysis using gephi. With the network we could easily determine the origin of the tweet, their distribution. Replies and retweets were taken into consideration. Each tweet is a node and each reply/retweet is an edge and the graph is relative to the weight.
